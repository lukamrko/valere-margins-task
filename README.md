## Additional author notes

Users have visible password for the purpose of easier testing. If this was the real task I would at least use salt+hash.

DB queries are not optimized. Introduction of caching would solve 90% of issues, but I didn't do it because of time constraints.

Tests weren't written because of lack of time.
